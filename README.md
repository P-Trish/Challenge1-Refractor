# Challenge1-Refractor


## Description

This website was a challenge for the Full-stack coding bootcamp course.  It portrayed a scenario that could prepare students for what they'd encounter in real-life as a web developer.  An on-the-job ticket was simulated as students were challenged to modify and clean up the starter code.  The simulation was presented as this: You are being hired by a client to help with their website.  The task is a code refractor to improve the code without changing what it does for the website of the marketing agency called "Horiseon."  When cleaning up the code web accessibility standards were also considered and implemented to meet requirements.   Duplicate CSS properties were also consolidated to clean up code.This solves the issue of hard-to-read code by making it syntactically readable and disability accessible.   In this simulation, I was put in a real-life issue that may arise in my future as a web developer.
