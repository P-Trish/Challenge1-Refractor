# Challenge1-Refractor


## Description

This website was a challenge for the Full-stack coding bootcamp course.  It portrayed a scenario that could prepare students for what they'd encounter in real-life as a web developer.  An on-the-job ticket was simulated as students were challenged to modify and clean up the starter code. The task was a code refractor to improve the code without changing what it does for the website of a marketing agency called "Horiseon."  When cleaning up the code web accessibility standards were also considered and implemented to meet requirements.   Duplicate CSS properties were also consolidated to clean up code.
